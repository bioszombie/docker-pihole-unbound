# 99-edns.conf

# This configuration file is dedicated to EDNS (Extension Mechanisms for DNS) settings
# to optimize DNS queries and responses, prevent fragmentation, and enhance security.

# Set the maximum EDNS packet size to 1232 bytes.
# This helps avoid fragmentation issues, ensuring reliable DNS resolution.
edns-packet-max=1232

# Enforce the use of DNSSEC by requiring validation on DNS responses.
# This setting ensures that DNS data is authentic and hasn't been tampered with.
dnssec=allow-downgrade

# Specify the maximum number of simultaneous DNS queries allowed to be sent out.
# This setting helps prevent DNS query overload in high-traffic environments.
dns-forward-max=150

# Enable DNS query prefetching for better performance.
# Frequently queried domains will be prefetched before their TTL expires,
# reducing latency for subsequent queries.
cache-size=10000
cache-min-ttl=300
cache-max-ttl=86400

# Enable or disable the compression of DNS responses.
# Compression can save bandwidth but might introduce additional processing overhead.
edns-udp-size=4096
compress=no

# Enable or disable the sending of client subnet information to upstream resolvers.
# This setting can improve location-based services, but may reduce privacy.
send-client-subnet=no

# Enable strict DNSSEC validation.
# This ensures that any DNSSEC failure results in a DNS resolution failure,
# providing stronger security at the expense of availability.
harden-dnssec=yes
